    Preventative Maintenance Vendors vs. Emergency Response:  
    Building the Right Mix in Manufactured Housing Communities
  </h1>

<section>
  <p>
    Most community operators inherit a vendor strategy built around crisis management. Water main breaks on weekends.
    Emergency road repairs after storms. Electrical distribution failures requiring immediate response.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reactive approach looks cheaper—pay only when something breaks. But the true cost shows up in after-hours
    premiums, compounding infrastructure damage, resident dissatisfaction, and operational chaos that becomes
    the norm rather than the exception.
  </p>

  <h2>The Land-Lease Maintenance Reality</h2>

  <p>
    The maintenance responsibility in land-lease communities differs fundamentally from multifamily.
    Residents own their homes and handle everything inside: HVAC, plumbing, appliances, repairs.
    Community operators maintain only the infrastructure and common areas that serve everyone.
  </p>

  <h3>What Community Operators Maintain</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Water and sewer lines (main to lot connection)</li>
    <li>Electrical distribution systems</li>
    <li>Roads and drainage</li>
    <li>Common facilities and amenities</li>
    <li>Landscaping of common areas</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Residents Maintain</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Everything inside and attached to their homes</li>
    <li>Home-specific HVAC, plumbing, electrical</li>
    <li>Appliances and fixtures</li>
    <li>Structural home repairs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When community infrastructure fails, it doesn't affect one unit—it impacts multiple resident-owned homes
    simultaneously. A water line break affects 30 homes. An electrical failure hits an entire section.
    Road deterioration impacts everyone's property value.
  </p>

  <h2>The Real Cost of Reactive Maintenance</h2>

  <p>A typical infrastructure emergency at a 150-site community:</p>

  <h3>Friday Evening Water Main Break — Reactive Response</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Emergency plumber (weekend rate): $4,500</li>
    <li>Rush parts premium: Included</li>
    <li>Homes without water overnight: 30</li>
    <li>Angry resident calls: Multiple</li>
    <li>Negative online reviews: 2–3</li>
    <li>Total hard cost: $4,500</li>
    <li>Reputation cost: Unmeasured</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Same Issue — Preventative Catch</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled inspection (Tuesday): $1,800</li>
    <li>Standard-rate labor: Included</li>
    <li>Resident disruption: None</li>
    <li>Complaints: Zero</li>
    <li>Total cost: $1,800</li>
    <li>Savings: $2,700</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    One failure. Multiply across a year and a portfolio, and the economics become clear.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Portfolio-Level Economics</h2>

  <p>
    A regional operator managing five communities averaging 120 sites each faces this math:
  </p>

  <h3>Reactive Model</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Emergency repairs across portfolio: $175,000</li>
    <li>Average per community: $35,000</li>
    <li>Constant firefighting, resident complaints, reputation damage</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preventative Model</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled service contracts: $40,000 upfront</li>
    <li>Emergency repairs (reduced 60%): $70,000</li>
    <li>Net annual savings after year one: $65,000</li>
    <li>Improved resident satisfaction and retention</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For infill projects adding 40–50 sites over 12 months, building preventative maintenance into the
    operating budget from day one avoids the failure patterns that create expensive emergencies in years 3–7.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>What Preventative Maintenance Requires</h2>

  <h3>Emergency Response Vendors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Immediate availability for crises</li>
    <li>Broad capability across multiple issues</li>
    <li>Willingness to work after-hours</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preventative Maintenance Vendors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled availability and reliability</li>
    <li>Deep understanding of MH community infrastructure</li>
    <li>Systematic documentation and reporting</li>
    <li>Long-term relationship orientation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Service Level Agreements That Actually Work</h2>

  <p>
    Handshake agreements don't create accountability. Formal SLAs with measurable standards do.
  </p>

  <h3>Emergency Response SLA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Critical infrastructure: Same day</li>
    <li>Urgent issues: 24 hours</li>
    <li>Routine work: 48–72 hours</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preventative Maintenance SLA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Quarterly water/sewer inspections</li>
    <li>Semi-annual electrical inspections</li>
    <li>Annual road inspections</li>
    <li>Written documentation within 48 hours</li>
    <li>Identification of components needing replacement in 6–12 months</li>
    <li>4-hour emergency response guarantee for covered infrastructure</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Operational Shift Required</h2>

  <p>
    This transition goes beyond new vendor contracts—it changes how community managers approach their role.
  </p>

  <h3>What Changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracking scheduled maintenance completion, not just emergency response</li>
    <li>Community managers coordinating preventative service as a core function</li>
    <li>Regional oversight measuring infrastructure uptime</li>
    <li>Recognition systems rewarding prevention over crisis heroics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Leadership determines which behaviors are reinforced.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Building Vendor Mix at Scale</h2>

  <h3>Effective Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Centralized vendor qualification and SLA standards</li>
    <li>Localized vendor selection by regional managers</li>
    <li>Vendor scorecards tracking performance and cost efficiency</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Vendor Strategy by Infrastructure Type</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Water/sewer: Preventative contracts</li>
    <li>Electrical distribution: Preventative contracts</li>
    <li>Roads and drainage: Preventative contracts</li>
    <li>Specialized equipment: On-demand</li>
    <li>Seasonal services: Case-by-case</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why This Matters More in MH Communities</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Residents’ owned property is directly impacted</li>
    <li>Home values and long-term investment are at risk</li>
    <li>Emotional and financial stakes exceed rental housing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Community operators are protecting residents’ largest financial asset.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Transition Path</h2>

  <h3>Phase One — Water/Sewer</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled inspections across portfolio</li>
    <li>Monthly tracking of emergency calls</li>
    <li>Year-over-year cost comparison</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Typical Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>50–60% reduction in emergency calls</li>
    <li>$25,000–$30,000 annual savings</li>
    <li>Improved resident satisfaction</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase Two — Electrical and Roads</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Expanded preventative scope</li>
    <li>Vendor relationships that reward prevention</li>
    <li>Refined internal systems</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Economic Reality</h2>

  <p>
    The financial benefits are measurable—$60,000+ in annual savings across a mid-sized portfolio.
    But the operational benefits drive long-term value: fewer emergencies, higher satisfaction,
    stronger retention, and better referrals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Operators who build preventative vendor strategies now gain structural advantages that compound.
    The rest continue paying weekend emergency premiums and dealing with retention challenges they
    cannot quite explain.
