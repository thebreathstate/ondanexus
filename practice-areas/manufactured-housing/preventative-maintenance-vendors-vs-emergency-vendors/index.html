    <h1>Preventative Maintenance Vendors vs. Emergency Response: Building the Right Mix in Manufactured Housing Communities</h1>

    <p>
      Most of us inherited a vendor strategy built around crisis management. Water main breaks on weekends.
      Emergency road repairs after storms. Electrical distribution failures requiring immediate response.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reactive approach looks cheaper—you only pay when something breaks. But after managing community
      infrastructure for years, I've learned the hard way that this model costs far more than the invoice shows.
      After-hours premiums, compounding damage, angry residents, and the chaos of managing by emergency all add up.

    <h2>The Land-Lease Maintenance Reality</h2>

    <p>
      Our maintenance responsibility is fundamentally different from multifamily. Residents own their homes and
      handle everything inside: HVAC, plumbing, appliances, repairs. We maintain the infrastructure and common
      areas that serve the entire community.
    </p>

    <h3>What Community Operators Actually Maintain</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Water and sewer lines (main to lot connection)</li>
      <li>Electrical distribution systems</li>
      <li>Roads and drainage</li>
      <li>Common facilities and amenities</li>
      <li>Landscaping of common areas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Residents Maintain</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Everything inside and attached to their homes</li>
      <li>Home-specific HVAC, plumbing, electrical</li>
      <li>Appliances and fixtures</li>
      <li>Structural home repairs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When our infrastructure fails, we don't fix one unit—we affect multiple resident-owned homes simultaneously.
      A water line break impacts 30 homes. An electrical failure affects an entire section. Road deterioration hits
      everyone's property value.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Real Cost of Reactive Maintenance</h2>

    <p>Here's what a typical infrastructure emergency actually costs at a 150-site community:</p>

    <h3>Friday Evening Water Main Break — Reactive Response</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">Cost Item</th>
          <th align="left">Amount</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Emergency plumber (weekend rate)</td><td>$4,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Rush parts premium</td><td>Included</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Homes without water overnight</td><td>30</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Angry resident calls</td><td>Multiple</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Negative online reviews</td><td>2–3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Total hard cost</td><td>$4,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reputation cost</td><td>Unmeasured</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Same Issue — Preventative Catch</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">Cost Item</th>
          <th align="left">Amount</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Scheduled inspection (Tuesday)</td><td>$1,800</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Standard-rate labor</td><td>Included</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Resident disruption</td><td>None</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Complaints</td><td>Zero</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Total cost</td><td>$1,800</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Savings</td><td>$2,700</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>That's one failure. Multiply this across a year and a portfolio.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Portfolio Economics</h2>

    <p>
      I manage five communities averaging 120 sites each. Here's what the transition looked like for us:
    </p>

    <h3>Annual Infrastructure Maintenance — Reactive Model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Emergency repairs across portfolio: $175,000</li>
      <li>Average per community: $35,000</li>
      <li>Constant firefighting, resident complaints</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Annual Infrastructure Maintenance — Preventative Model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scheduled service contracts: $40,000 upfront</li>
      <li>Emergency repairs (reduced 60%): $70,000</li>
      <li>Net annual savings after year one: $65,000</li>
      <li>Measurably happier residents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For infill projects where we're adding 40–50 sites over 12 months, we build preventative maintenance into the
      operating budget from day one. New infrastructure under scheduled contracts doesn't develop the failure
      patterns that create expensive emergencies in years 3–7.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Preventative Actually Requires</h2>

    <p>
      The shift from reactive to preventative isn't just hiring different vendors—it's rebuilding how we approach
      infrastructure management.
    </p>

    <h3>Emergency Response Vendors Need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate availability for crises</li>
      <li>Broad capability across multiple issues</li>
      <li>Willingness to work after-hours</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preventative Maintenance Vendors Need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scheduled availability and reliability</li>
      <li>Deep relationship with our properties</li>
      <li>Systematic documentation and reporting</li>
      <li>Understanding of MH community infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Service Level Agreements That Work</h2>

    <p>We stopped doing handshake agreements and built actual SLAs. Here's what we require:</p>

    <h3>Emergency Response SLA</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">Issue Type</th>
          <th align="left">Response Time</th>
          <th align="left">Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Critical infrastructure</td>
          <td>Same day</td>
          <td>Water main break, electrical distribution failure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Urgent issues</td>
          <td>24 hours</td>
          <td>Road damage affecting access, drainage failure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Routine work</td>
          <td>48–72 hours</td>
          <td>Minor repairs, scheduled improvements</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Preventative Maintenance SLA</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspection schedules: Quarterly (water/sewer), semi-annual (electrical), annual (roads)</li>
      <li>Minor repairs: Completed during inspection visit</li>
      <li>Documentation: Written reports within 48 hours</li>
      <li>Flagging: Components needing replacement within 6–12 months identified</li>
      <li>Emergency guarantee: 4-hour response on infrastructure under contract</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The pricing works for both sides—vendors get predictable volume and scheduling efficiency,
      we get lower per-site costs and performance guarantees.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Operational Shift</h2>

    <p>
      This transition required more than new vendor contracts. We had to change how community managers think
      about their role.
    </p>

    <h3>What Changed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Software: Track scheduled maintenance completion, not just emergency response times</li>
      <li>Community manager role: Coordinating preventative service became core responsibility, not admin burden</li>
      <li>Regional oversight: Measure program performance (declining emergencies, infrastructure uptime) not just crisis response speed</li>
      <li>Recognition: Celebrate prevention metrics, not heroic firefighting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The cultural shift was harder than I expected. Reactive maintenance rewards visible crisis management—everyone sees the Saturday
      water main fix. Preventative maintenance rewards invisible reliability—residents never experience disruptions because we caught
      issues early.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Building Vendor Mix at Scale</h2>

    <p>
      Managing 8–12 communities (100–150 sites each), we had to answer: centralize vendor management or allow property-level relationships?
    </p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Centralized: Vendor qualification standards, SLA templates, approved vendor lists</li>
      <li>Localized: Regional managers select from qualified vendors for their markets</li>
      <li>Accountability: Vendor scorecards tracking response times, completion rates, cost per work order, callback frequency</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vendor Strategy by Infrastructure Category</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">Infrastructure Category</th>
          <th align="left">Vendor Strategy</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Water/sewer distribution</td><td>Preventative contracts with performance guarantees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Electrical distribution</td><td>Preventative contracts with performance guarantees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Roads and drainage</td><td>Preventative contracts with performance guarantees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Specialized equipment</td><td>On-demand relationships</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Seasonal services</td><td>Evaluate case-by-case</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why This Matters More in MH</h2>

    <p>The land-lease model amplifies everything. When infrastructure fails:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Residents don't just lose service—their owned property is impacted</li>
      <li>They worry about damage to their investment, their home values</li>
      <li>The emotional and financial stakes are higher than rental housing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real consequences we've seen</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Water main breaks flooding crawl spaces, damaging home foundations</li>
      <li>Electrical failures damaging resident HVAC systems, appliances, electronics</li>
      <li>Road deterioration affecting property values and resale ability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're not just maintaining infrastructure—we're protecting residents' largest financial asset.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Actually Made the Transition</h2>

    <h3>Year One — Water/Sewer Focus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented scheduled inspections across all five communities over 6 months</li>
      <li>Tracked emergency calls and costs monthly</li>
      <li>Compared spending to previous year</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>55% reduction in emergency water/sewer calls by month 12</li>
      <li>$28,000 savings across portfolio in year one</li>
      <li>Resident satisfaction scores improved on infrastructure reliability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Year Two — Expand to Electrical and Roads</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied same methodology to electrical distribution and road maintenance</li>
      <li>Built vendor relationships that actually reward prevention</li>
      <li>Refined internal systems supporting scheduled maintenance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For New Infill Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Build preventative maintenance into pro forma operating expenses from start</li>
      <li>New infrastructure under scheduled service contracts from installation</li>
      <li>Avoid failure patterns that create costly emergencies in years 3–7</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>
      After making this transition, I can't imagine going back to reactive-only maintenance. The financial benefits are real—$60,000+ annual
      savings across our portfolio. But the operational benefits matter more: fewer middle-of-the-night calls, happier residents, better retention,
      stronger referrals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Residents who own their homes care deeply about infrastructure reliability. When we maintain it systematically instead of reactively, they notice.
      That shows up in lifetime value, which drives returns more than occupancy snapshots ever will.
    </p>

    <p>
      The operators figuring this out now will have structural cost advantages and resident satisfaction advantages that compound over time.
      The rest will keep paying weekend emergency premiums and wondering why their retention numbers lag.
